    <h1>TEAGLASS (TGLSS)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Whitepaper — English Version</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tea is one of the rare habits that has remained unchanged for centuries. Technology, money, and lifestyles evolve — tea simply stays. It brings people together, slows down the rush, and makes conversation possible.</p>
    <p>TEAGLASS looks at this continuity as a <strong>culture meme</strong>. It is not a claim. It is not a promise.</p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>Tea has walked quietly through history.</p>
    <p>From ancient China’s mountain paths to the caravans of Central Asia, from Ottoman tea houses to British afternoon rituals — tea never tried to lead revolutions. It simply stayed.</p>
    <p>Empires rose and fell. Currencies collapsed. Technologies replaced each other. Tea remained the same small moment of pause in human life.</p>
    <p>TEAGLASS takes inspiration from this continuity. Not from trends. Not from speed. From the slow confidence of something that does not need to prove itself.</p>
    <p>This project does not build grand narratives or artificial urgency. It rests on a simple truth: tea is brewed, shared, and continues.</p>
    <p>No exaggerated promises. No complicated structures. Just enough space for culture to breathe — and enough tea for everyone.</p>

    <h2>The Tea Man</h2>
    <p>The teaman brews tea for those who come to drink it.</p>
    <p>The teaman is not a manager. Does not set prices. Does not give direction.</p>
    <p>The teaman only makes sure the water keeps boiling.</p>

    <h2>Token Structure</h2>
    <p><strong>Token Name:</strong> TEAGLASS</p>
    <p><strong>Symbol:</strong> TGLSS</p>
    <p><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 18,101,981,000 TGLSS</p>
    <p>The full supply is created at launch. Circulation forms naturally over time.</p>

    <h2>Liquidity Structure</h2>
    <p>Liquidity is supported through practical and transparent actions, not promises.</p>
    <p>When needed, liquidity may be added manually to improve trading conditions and continuity.</p>
    <p>This project does not claim automatic liquidity mechanisms, permanent price stability, or guaranteed depth.</p>
    <p>Liquidity conditions depend on market activity and available resources.</p>
    <p><strong>There is no fixed liquidity lock period.</strong> If any lock is applied in the future, its terms and proof will be shared publicly.</p>

    <h2>No Roadmap for Sale</h2>
    <p>This project does not sell a roadmap. Because tea has no roadmap.</p>
    <p>It is drunk today, and it will be drunk tomorrow.</p>
    <p>This is a culture meme.</p>

    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>TEAGLASS is not an investment product. It is not a promise.</p>
    <p>Drinking tea is a pleasure. Sometimes, it simply takes the tiredness away.</p>
    <p>And tea always finds its way.</p>
    <p><strong>TEAGLASS IS NOT A COMMUNITY.<br>
    IT IS A CULTURAL BROTHERHOOD.</strong></p>
